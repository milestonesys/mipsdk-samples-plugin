# Milestone Integration Platform Software Development Kit plug-in integration samples

The Milestone Integration Platform (MIP) enables fast and flexible integration between
Milestone XProtect video management software (VMS), applications available from
[Milestone Marketplace](<https://www.milestonesys.com/community/marketplace/>),
and other third-party applications and devices.

The Milestone Integration Platform Software Development Kit (MIP SDK) offers a suite of integration options, including

- protocol integration
- component integration (stand-alone applications using MIP .NET libraries)
- plug-in integration (hosted by XProtect application environments)

This repo contains samples that demonstrate MIP SDK plug-in integration.

The plug-in integration samples cover these key areas of XProtect VMS functionality:
